Containers!!

	Docker Engine
	
	Images vs Containers ?
	


Infra-Structure Team :

	Jenkins - Master Slave Configuration!!!
	
	Jenkins-Master:
		
			Slave1 ===> Build and Create Artifacts for Java Application
			Slave2 ===> Python
			Slave3 ===> .Net
			Slave4 ===> NodeJs
			Slave5 ===> Angular
				 50 ===> 

Virtual Machines!!!!

	Jenkins-Master
	
		Virtual Machine --> Docker Container Engine 


DEV Team :

	DEV-Environment					==> TEST Environment 				==> Prod. Environment
	(jdk1.8,tomcat8)						QA(jdk1.7,tomcat7)
	created *.war							UAT
	(Package: *.war,jdk1.8,tomcat8)			Staging Environment
	Image - Docker Image 
	Container Registry (docker hub)
	AWS EKS
	Az	AKS
	GCP

Container Orchestration!  Docker Swarm 

	Monolithic Application Architecture!
				(vs)
	Microservice Based Architecture!

Web-Based applications!!!

Monolithic Application Architecture!

Process --> 	
	E-Commerce :
		sign-up
		sign-in
		search
		purchase
		payment

All these process are deployed as single service/application!	(Stateful / Stateless Application)

Microservice Based Architecture!
Process --> 	
	E-Commerce :
		sign-up		--> collect the user data, validate the user data, store in dbase
		sign-in			v1.0		==> v1.1 validate the user data
		search
		purchase
		payment

All these process are deployed as independent service! === > shd be deployed as containers 


	1 service === 1 process ====> Microservice
	
DownTime!

Container Orchestrator!!!		Kubernetes

		To Ensure High Availability of containers
		Quickly revert / rollback the changes 
		Load-Balancer

Docker Swarm 		vs 			Kubernetes

Docker-Compose -- Manifest File *.yaml to manage multiple containers!
				*.war
				tomcat 
				mysql 

Dockerfile is used to build docker images!
 
Created Multiple Containers :::

docker ps -a

	DEV-Team
			Stateless	- (*.war/jdk1.8/nginx-1.1.9)  ==
			
			Stateful 
						- (*.war/jdk1.8/nginx-1.1.9)  ==  (Needs some volume)   container-v1.1 - Active Container
																				container-v1.1 - Passive Container

						- (*.war/jdk1.8/nginx-1.1.9)  ==  (Needs some volume) 	container-v1.1 - Active Container	
																				(Run Webapp, mysql db)

						- Config files / Secrets / Security Vaults
						
Container Pattern

Installation Process & pre-requisities

	Install Kubernetes Master and Configure Worker Nodes!
	
	Installation :::
	
		- 	Minikube
		-	play with kubernetes
		-	play with docker
		-	Kubeadm 
		-	Using Managed Services ( AWS/Az/GCP )
		
		
Kube-Master	, WN1, WN2 ...100

	Run some Pods 
		DEV		Namespace 
		QA
		UAT
		PROD 
		
Create a POD

Manifest file ---> *.yaml
